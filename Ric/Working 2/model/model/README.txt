- model_clustering_attmp01 : Hierarchical clustering code. Too many branches.
- model_Her0_0-01 : Attempted to separate observed filaments with kmean and DBScan. DBScan was more successful. 1st attempt at predicting PCA space -> comercial value with S4D Gumbo.
- model_Her0_0-02: S4D Jengi = (PCASpace -> log comercial value). S4D Gumbo = (log comercial value -> "corrected" comercial value). S4D Her0 1st architecture failed.
- model_Her0_0-03 : Introduced RESNet architecture. S4D Jengi = Residual block. Reduced scope of prediction. S4D Her0 successful.
- model_Her0-1-00 : Training script for individual regions.
- model_Her0-1-01 : Added sanitizing functions. Latest final model script.
